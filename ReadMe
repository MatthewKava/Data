Car price assignment is a project for my Diploma in data analytics at the Fitzwilliam Institute in Dublin. 
The Data was taken from Kaggle. 
The aim is to clean and explore the data, make a multiple linear regression model and evaluate the accuracy by splitting into train and test datasets. 
The accuracy of this model was also compared to a random forest regression model and a principal component analysis model.
